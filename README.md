# Raa Labs custom Grafana plugins

To get going, you first need to download the dependencies with `yarn install`.

To test the plugins locally, run either `yarn build` or `yarn start` in the directory of the plugin you want to install.
Then, run `yarn server` in the root of the repository, to start the Grafana instance in Docker with the locally built plugins available - then go to http://localhost:3000
